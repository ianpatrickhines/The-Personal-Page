The site makes use of the jQuery Backstretch plugin 
from Scott Robbin. Gracias.

=============================

This simple one-page website is a way for people to have a very quick and easy personable website that aggregates your activity and positions a simple logo, a portrait and some description text in a nicely-formatted manner. This is licensed under the MIT and GPL licenses.

Usage is simple:

1) You'll need to edit the index.html file with your own text. Don't forget to edit the monogram text, as well. 

2) [Optional] edit the style.css file with your own custom CSS. 

3) Upload your own portrait as the background. Don't impersonate me!

4) Upload all the files, including the MIT and GPL licences. 

5) You can switch the position of the monogram and text as seen in timlum.com.
