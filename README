=============================

This simple one-page website is a way for people to have a very quick and easy personable website that aggregates your activity and positions a simple logo, a portrait and some description text in a nicely-formatted manner. This is licensed under the MIT and GPL licenses. 

See the original: http://thepersonalpage.me/demo

See others' versions:

http://timlum.com

Usage is simple:

1) You'll need to edit the index.html file with your own text. Don't forget to edit the monogram text, as well. 

2) [Optional] edit the style.css file with your own custom CSS. 

3) Upload your own portrait as the background. Don't impersonate me!

4) Upload all the files, including the MIT and GPL licences. 

5) You can switch the position of the monogram and text as seen in timlum.com. 

=============================

Regarding the Symbolset Font:

This version of The Personal Page makes use of Symbolset (http://symbolset.com). 

Symbolsets are semantic symbol fonts. They work in modern browsers and anywhere OpenType features are supported.

The use of Symbolset's fonts is governed by their product license, which can be found here: http://symbolset.com/license/

If you intend to use Symbolset fonts in your own iteration of The Personal Page, you must purchase your own license from http://symbolset.com. They're quite affordable, and are well worth the money.
